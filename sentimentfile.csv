In my defence I thought I was voting in support of membership of a free trade area it was not made clear at the time that this would lead to a loss of sovereignty control of our borders etc. together with some very odd decisions from the European Courts some verging on the frankly bizarre! All this perpetrated in the main by a largely un-elected elite of European civil servants spending large sums of money some provided by us in respect of which no credible audited accounts are available!
